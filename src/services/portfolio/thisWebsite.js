I also wanted to apply my new personal style of my projects to this new portfolio, so I started the project with all the configuration part and on my social media I've been posting my progress, and also deploying those versions on my <a href='https://demo.relisalazar.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>demo site</a>. I also wanted to start using some new toys, like the last version of React, (v18) and Jest for some unit testing. Also, I've prepared services that simulates API calls so I could replace ALL the content with a CRUD and an API with a database later, so, make posts will be easier.",

Also, there is the art section, with all those images and it's arrangement and the moday that blurs the rest of the view. Take a look for all the page! and if you want to, you also can take a look at the code, because I made it public and you can found it at this <a href='https://github.com/ReliSalazar/portfolio-react' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>github repository</a>!",
