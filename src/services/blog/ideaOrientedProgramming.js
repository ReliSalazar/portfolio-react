Broadly speaking, we could explain it as a series of three dualisms to explain reality.",

Ideas are the foundation, the base, the condition of possibillity of things, that things are what they are and that we can know them, because if there were nothing stable or permanent in change, we couldn't know.\nIdeas are the true reality, everything that is real in things, they owe to ideas.",

That is, instead of having a variable called temperature, we have an object called thermometer, which has a numerical property that reflects the current temperature, data that it gives us through a method, and through another method it's constantly changing. It is, indeed the idea of a thermometer represented through the code.\nWhen we write software and we extract all procedural thinking from our code and focus solely on using objects, the object becomes a software abstracton of reality.\nWhen you write software, you are translating your ideas, your concepts, into code. Ideas that live in the machine that executes it, through its behaviors and interactions with other objects, all defined by you.
